		First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Adrian Perrig and the whole Network Security Group at ETH Zurich for the opportunity of working on this project.
		
		I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors Prof. David Hausheer and Dr. Ercan Ucan for the many discussions and their support throughout this thesis. Without their input, this thesis would not have been possible.
		
		Finally, I would like to express my profound gratitude to my family for the continuous encouragement and the unconditioned support throughout my studies. Thank you.
