Using a case study we explore how network zoning is realized in modern enterprise networks, and later we derive the main challenges we confront.

\section{Case Study}

	\label{fig:usecase}
\end{figure}

Most enterprise networks have embraced the notion of layered security classification,
that can be broadly split into intranet, extranet, and opennet~\cite{ramasamy2011towards}.
The opennet is the least trusted network (e.g., the Internet) which is an inhospitable region
where live threats exist, whereas the intranet is the most trusted network hosting
business-critical systems and sensitive information. Since the intranet has rigorous access
control mechanisms to protect information assets from exposure to the opennet, enterprises are
forced to operate another security layer (extranet, also known as demilitarized zone or DMZ) in between,
which exposes the publicly accessible services to the opennet, while reducing the attack surface of the intranet.

Over time, these layered network structures have become more sophisticated~\cite{obregon2015infrastructure}
due to extreme changes in network environments---diverse demands from customers, partners
and employees accessing enterprise networks with a variety of devices.
As a result, many enterprise networks
comprise a large number of zones defined by operational, organizational, and most
importantly security factors. Figure~\ref{fig:usecase} depicts a real-world use case for
network zones running on inter-domain level with multiple involved autonomous systems (ASes). They
can be categorized into three main types.

\paragraph{Intra-domain Zone Transfer}
% 1. direct transfer
% 2. through trasit zone
Within a local network, multiple devices such as servers, databases, and hosts are connected
through network switches. These devices are assigned with a unique IP address that belongs
to a logically isolated network zone. These zones commonly consist of multiple subnets,
often realized with a layer 2 virtualization technology (e.g., VLAN). Each zone is protected
by a set of security middleboxes, e.g., firewalls, intrusion-prevention systems (IPS),
and intrusion-detection systems (IDS), which enforce predefined security policies for all
traffic passing through.

To maintain the zone-based trust model, access permission to one zone is not considered to be
valid for other zones. That is, an entity must obtain access permissions from all zones on the
path when accessing a non-adjacent zone. This trust model however often complicates policy management
and enforcement, especially for large enterprise networks.
To resolve this complication, the current practice introduces the notion of a dedicated zone in which zone
transitions are handled, called Transit Zone.

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\caption{\textit{Two ways of structuring network zones. The use of a transit zone on the right side reduces
			the number of required links.}}
	\label{fig:zone_layout}
\end{figure}

A transit zone acts like a patch panel, allowing zones to be interconnected without the need
of a dedicated link between each pair of zones (Figure~\ref{fig:zone_layout}).
The Transit zone sits in the middle of all
the other zones and mediates access between zones wishing to communicate with each other.
It is commonly comprised of only forwarding devices (e.g., switches), interconnecting the
attached zones via various ingress/egress points on which security middleboxes enforce the
security policies. In a nutshell, the Transit Zone reduces the depth of zone hierarchies and
thus simplifies the network zone design and management.

\paragraph{Inter-domain Zone Transfer}
% bridging sites is expensive
To ensure that geographically distributed zones can securely communicate with each other,
enterprises employ various networking technologies. The most common choice is connecting
two remote sites with a physical private line, (e.g., layer 2 circuit). Enterprises
can lease these lines from Internet service providers and make use of them to bridge local
networks. However, purchasing private lines is costly and might come along
with trust issues towards the service provider.

An alternative is a virtual private
network (VPN). A VPN uses cryptographic primitives to create a virtual tunnel between two
local networks, preventing information leakage during transmission over the public Internet.
While the VPN technology ensures data confidentiality, typically yet another layer of overlay
protocols is required to achieve virtual separation of zones. The use of such overlay
protocols, however, has the disadvantage that all interconnected sites need to deploy the same
protocol since such protocols generally do not offer interoperability.

\paragraph{Traffic from the Internet}
% 1. normal customer
% 2. authorised user (employee)
% 3. attacker
Traffic not originating in cooperative (trusted) networks can be classified
into the following three types: i) public traffic, ii) authorized traffic, and iii)
malicious traffic. The first case covers normal customers who access the enterprise's
public services, e.g., Web servers. This traffic in general ends up at the demilitarized zone
(DMZ) hosting only public services that require exposure to Internet.
The second case refers to the traffic coming from temporarily authorized devices. For example,
a legitimate employee outside the enterprise's premises---working from home with a personal
device---may get a temporal permit to access restricted zones via VPN. The last
category comprises attack traffic which is to be filtered by the security middleboxes in the
frontline of defense.

\section{Challenges}
\label{sec:challenges}

\paragraph{Secure Zone Transfer}
Transmitting security-sensitive data between zones in different physical locations (e.g.,
data center to branch site) over the public Internet poses a challenge.
Security level information is lost in transit, requiring that the data is re-authenticated and
filtered again on the receiving site even though source and destination could be part of the
same logical zone.
Today's overlay protocols are often used to overcome the restriction of losing
security level information in transit. This, however, introduces new challenges: difficulties
in deployment per zone, computational overhead, and poor management scalability.

\paragraph{Interoperability}
Even if security-level information persists in transit, networks of different branch sites might
not be built on the same internal protocols (e.g., SPB~\cite{ieee2012spb} vs
Trill~\cite{rfc6325}) which makes it difficult for end systems in different
zones to be able to seamlessly communicate with each other. A new architecture
therefore must be able to understand various network protocols and interpret
them into a common language that all target networks can understand. This means
that the interpretation should preserve the properties of an original protocol,
such as virtual layer 2 segmentation. A flexible design for the architecture to
easily adopt new protocols is also of importance.

\paragraph{Management Scalability}
In current local network zoning architectures, administration is being
considered a tedious, time-consuming, and labor-intensive task. For example,
simply adding a new zone might require existing policies to be thoroughly
reviewed, updated, and re-distributed to the local network entities. The
management complexity dramatically increases in a wide-area network (WAN)
environment. For global orchestration across heterogeneous environments, a new
architecture therefore must ensure management scalability. That is, network
administrators should be able to easily extend network zones in different
physical locations and update policies that reflect these network changes, and
be assured that no security loopholes were introduced.






% \subsection{Industrial Perspectives}

% % \paragraph{Large Enterprise Networks}
% % In order to protect information technology assets, large enterprise networks are partitioned into disjoint segments which group together assets with the same security requirements and policies. These groups are referred to as zones. Zones define the network boundaries and their defense requirements by stating the entities populating the zones, the entry points into the zone as well as how traffic is monitored and filtered at these entry points. Oftentimes, these zones are realized by a (virtualized) separation at layer 2 with firewalls at higher levels governing data transfers between zones.
% Traditionally, enterprises used to consider three security layers for their network 
% environment: intranet, extranet and opennet~\cite{ramasamy2011towards}. The opennet is
% the least trusted network (e.g., the Internet) which is inhospitable region where live 
% threats exist, while the intranet is the most trusted network hosting business-critical 
% systems and sensitive information. Since the intranet has rigorous access controls to 
% protect the information assets from an exposure, enterprises put another security layer 
% (extranet) in between, that only exposes public services to opennet and thus reduces 
% attack surfaces. 
% As enterprises have recently witnessed extreme changes in network environment such as
% diverse demands from customers, partners and employees accessing their network with
% variety of devices, the enterprises employ more sophisticated network security 
% segmentation\cite{obregon2015infrastructure}, called security zones.
% Security zones constitute the logical grouping of one or more subnets that share the
% same security requirements and policies. 
% % Since security zoning is the foundation of 
% % network isolation criteria that must be upheld for secure business environements, 
% % the zone classification of information assets requires 

% Each security zone is identified with different level of trust, and every pair of zones 
% are defined with a namely trusted-untrusted relationship. 
% To realize the unidirectional trust model, firewalls are considered as the most viable
% technologies and widely used in the current practice. However, operating firewalls in 
% large enterprises is often challenging to network operators and security architects. The 
% access control for the security zones might be dynamic, and thus its requires a complex 
% management scheme to accommodate a myriad set of policies. While there are advanced 
% technologies such as virtual firewall~\cite{deng2015vnguard,bakker2016network} and Unified
% Threat Management (UTM)~\cite{qi2007towards}, that are newly designed for enforcement of 
% access control polices in extremely dynamic networks, security zone management and modeling 
% still remains to be evolved~\cite{ramasamy2011towards,gontarczyk2015blueprint}.

% Bridging geographically distant security zones can also be challenging. Oftentimes,
% security zones are created not only for security purpose but also because of geographical
% factors. Given that the security zones in distance should exchange information over
% public network (opennet as aforementioned), there might be a potential risk that the
% communication may expose security-sensitive information during transit. To mitigate
% such a threat, network operators leverage additional security control/mechanisms (e.g.,
% IPSec~\cite{rfc4301} and SSL VPN~\cite{sun2011advantages}) which ensure confidentiality
% and integrity of the transmission over the untrusted network by encrypting the data with
% securely shared cryptographic keys. Nonetheless, the technologies might bring new challenges
% such as management scalability~\cite{felsch2018dangers} and compatibility to the secure 
% isolation~\cite{liu2008collaborative}.

% % \paragraph{Cloud Computing (LaaS, PaaS, SaaS)}
% The cloud computing environment is a good representative example that depicts such practical 
% challenges. Cloud-based service providers operate large multi-tenant data centers which 
% have to scale to customers needs. To achieve this scalability while at the same time staying
% cost efficient cloud providers make heavy use of virtualization techniques. This environment 
% challenges operators with providing secure segmentation between tenants as multiple tenants 
% are using the same physical machines and network. In addition, given that the cloud 
% environments comprise geographically distributed data centers, providing secure communication 
% channels between security zones while upholding a constant view of the security policies
% under the dynamic zone migration is another hill to climb. Now, we derive main challenges 
% we confront in this research with case study.
% % Legal requirements need to be respected. Furthermore, an optimal solution needs to be highly 
% % flexible as the number of assigned resources for a given customer can change frequently.



% % \paragraph{Edge Computing}
% % With the rise of mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT) new types of data intensive, time
% sensitive applications are emerging. (e.g. VR/AR) However, since these devices are also required to
% be low power they cannot do these heavy computations themselves. Cloud computing can be used to
% offload the work to centralized data centers. However, this causes new challenges. Often, the latency
% between devices and the cloud is too high and therefore not well suited for real-time applications.
% Additionally, a large number of devices means that a centralized infrastructure can get saturated by
% big traffic flows. One widely used solution to this problem is Edge Computing which puts nodes handling
% the computation close to end devices.
