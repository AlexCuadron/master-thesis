	First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Adrian Perrig for providing me the opportunity of working
	on this fascinating project. The continued support is very appreciated.
								
	I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Jonghoon Kwon and Patrick Bamert for the
	many discussions and valuable insights. Without their help, this thesis would not have been possible.
