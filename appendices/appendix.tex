The controller database consists of 4 tables: \texttt{Zones}, \texttt{Sites}, \texttt{Subnets},
and \texttt{Transfers}. The \texttt{Zones} table contains all network zones known to the
controller, identified by zone IDs. Additionally, a human-readable description is attached. The
\texttt{Sites} table holds all known branch sites with the addresses of the corresponding \tps
and a textual description. The \texttt{Subnets} table describes the configured IP subnets
together with their zone membership and the \tp behind which they are located. Finally, the
\texttt{Transfers} table reflects the zone transfer matrix of allowed zone transfers.
